                    <p>
                        This site was created as a project for my beginning web development class. In this project we showcased our knowledge and skills with forms as well as
                        containers. I wanted to break out of my development comfort space and try to create a one-pager.

                    <p>
                        Penguin is a video chatting web application created to help accommodate those who had a hard time adjusting to the world's COVID-19 situation. My group
                        noticed that there were some accessible features many video chatting applications such as ZOOM and Skype. Some notable features designed were real-time transcription
                        that differentiated speakers, color blind friendly themes, and a light/dark mode.
