                    <h3>YouTube Case Study on Community Interaction & Restructuring for Information Overload</h3>
                    <h4>UX Case Study</h4>
                    <p>
                        As a long time user of YouTube, I personally noticed that there were noticeable differences between the mobile and desktop version of YouTube. Many features that made the flow easier for the mobile
                        version were not available on the Desktop version. With extesnive user research, competitive market analysis, and bringing these mobile features to the desktop site I redesigned YouTube to answer important 
                        issues that users had brought to my attention in the survey I conducted.

                    <h4>UX Principles Class & Passion Project</h4>
                    <p>
                        This product idea was passion project that I've had for a few years now and finally conceptualized & designed for my User Experience Principles class. RoomieBoard is a household organization
                        application meant to help keep personal relationships in tact as well.

                    <h3>Penguin</h3>
                    <h4>UX Research & Software Development Project</h4>
                    <p>
                        Penguin is a video chatting web application created to help accommodate those who had a hard time adjusting to the world's COVID-19 situation. My group
                        noticed that there were some accessible features many video chatting applications such as ZOOM and Skype. Some notable features designed were real-time transcription
                        that differentiated speakers, color blind friendly themes, and a light/dark mode.
