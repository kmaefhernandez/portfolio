                    <p>
                        This product was created for my User Experience Principles class but has always been an idea I've wanted to create for a few years now. RoomieBoard is a home organization
                        application but for those who have a hard time communicating. It was inspired by various roommate horror stories from friends, family, & colleagues and how many of these
                        households did have a corkboard to try and stay organized but it was easily forgotten. The solution? Make it digital and easy to reach at all times. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The design is widely based off of corkboards and the sticky notes placed for reminders. I also used a more calm and natural color scheme.  To learn more about my thought process,

                    <p>
                        This site was created as a project for my beginning web development class. In this project we showcased our knowledge and skills with forms as well as
                        containers. I wanted to break out of my development comfort space and try to create a mostly one-pager. Here I use name anchors so that a user could navigate
                        through the about, attractions, and video sections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the design I based it off of the city of <a href="https://www.redondo.org/">Redondo Beach's official website</a>. I took the color scheme they used but also
                        incorporated fonts that I felt spoke to me as the city I went to a lot in my childhood, "Redondo Beach".

                        Penguin is a video chatting web application created to help accommodate those who had a hard time adjusting to the world's COVID-19 situation. My group
                        noticed that there were some accessible features many video chatting applications such as ZOOM and Skype. Some notable features designed were real-time transcription
                        that differentiated speakers, color blind friendly themes, and a light/dark mode.

                        BAST Security is lock security system that was created alongside an Android application to control the system and its settings. Our group 
                        also developed a middleman to manage the connections between the application and the locks. I was most notably in charge of the front-end
                        and functionality of the Android application. 
                        
                        </br></br>The most notable features of BAST's Android application is that the administrators would be able
                        to: add and edit users & locks, control which users would would be able to have access to which locks, and log history files of the lock usage.

                        </br></br>I led the design team. The logo and theme of the application is based off of the Egyptian God of Protection.
