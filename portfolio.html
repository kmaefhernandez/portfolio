                    <p>
                        For this case study I conducted a user feedback study on the navigation and competitive market analysis research to come to three major conclusions: most users experience information overload from how the content is displayed, the navigation includes a lot of clutter that many
                        of the users never even noticed or used, and the lack of community interaction even though these features are widely available on the mobile application only. My redesign of some major YouTube pages addresses these issues. To learn more about how I came to this solution, feel free to check out my

                        RoomieBoard is a home organization application but for those who have a hard time communicating. It was inspired by various roommate horror stories from friends, family, & colleagues and how many of these
                        households did have a corkboard to try and stay organized but it was easily forgotten. The solution? Make it digital and easy to reach at all times. </br></br>

                        In this project, I wanted to break out of my development comfort space and try to create a mostly one-pager. Here I use name anchors so that a user could navigate
                        through the about, attractions, and video sections. </br></br>

                        For the design I based it off of the city of <a href="https://www.redondo.org/">Redondo Beach's official website</a>. I took the color scheme they used but also
                        incorporated fonts that I felt spoke to me as the city I went to a lot in my childhood, "Redondo Beach".

                        Penguin is a video chatting web application created to help accommodate those who had a hard time adjusting to the world's COVID-19 situation. My group
                        noticed that there were some accessible features many video chatting applications such as ZOOM and Skype. Some notable features designed were real-time transcription
                        that differentiated speakers, color blind friendly themes, and a light/dark mode.

                        BAST Security is lock security system that was created alongside an Android application to manage the system and its settings. Our group 
                        also developed a middleman to manage the connections between the application and the locks. I was most notably in charge of the Android application UI
                        and front-end functionality.
